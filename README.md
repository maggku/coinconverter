# Berry Swap  

Berry Swap is a cryptocurrency converter that lets you seamlessly exchange crypto altcoins and traditional currencies like **USD**, **EUR**, and **GBP**. BerrySwap is a project designed for beginners in cryptocurrency and blockchain. Experienced users usually buy tokens at the best price on crypto exchanges. However, BerrySwap allows quick token swaps, which is important in the fast-moving and risky crypto market. For this project, I chose a simpler approach, letting users trade real currency for popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This makes it easier for newcomers to get started in crypto without dealing with complex exchanges.

## Key Components  

### Dropdown Menus  
Users can effortlessly select cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies in **"Convert From"** and **"Convert To"** dropdown menus.  

### Input Fields  
A dedicated input field lets users specify the amount they wish to convert.  

### Exchange Rate Display  
Real-time exchange rates are dynamically displayed (e.g., 1 BTC = X USD), ensuring users have accurate and up-to-date information.
